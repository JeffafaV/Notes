/*
	Pointers point to other variables or objects in the program. This means that the value 
	that the pointer stores is an address. However, pointers can't just point to any variable 
	of any data type since it is limited to one data type. Pointers are declared with the * 
	symbol as well as a data type. The data type denotes that the pointer is able to store 
	addresses that hold values of that data type.
	
	Ex.
	int *x;
	
	The above example shows that x is a pointer of type int. This means that it can hold 
	the address of int variables.
	
	Ex.
	int **x;
	
	The above example shows that x is a pointer of type int pointer. This means that it 
	can hold the address of int pointer variables.
	
	Setting the value of a pointer to some address is known as referencing.
	
	Ex.
	int *p = &x;
	
	Retrieving the value stored in a memory address is known as dereferencing.
	
	Ex.
	
	cout << *p;
